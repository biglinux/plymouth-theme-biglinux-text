Description: graphical boot animation and logger - biglinux-text theme
 Plymouth is an application that runs very early in the boot process
 (even before the root filesystem is mounted!) that provides a graphical
 boot animation while the boot process happens in the background.
 .
 This package contains the default biglinux-text theme used when no
 support for a graphical theme is found on your system.
